# THE QUIZ OF ALL QUIZZES.

the main idea of this project was to create a small quiz of 20 question to be done by, our peers in the class so we can test our knowledge of php loops.

## Getting Started

CREATE A QUIZ

*Your goal is to create a quiz with 20 questions on a topic of your choice. Each question must have 4 possible answers with only one of them being correct.

Getting Started • Create an html page which has an empty form element. • Using PHP, create your questions in a variable and populate the empty form with the neccessary HTML markup needed. • User should be able to submit the quiz and their result should be shown to them e.g., "Congratulations, you got 17/20." • Show a message to a user after you have calculated their result. Use your own message text. For example:

Less than 10: Encourage them to try again

More than 10: Tell them they scored averagely

More than 15: They did well

Bonus:

Make your page pretty with some CSS.

Please go to this link to access the checklist of what's expected in more detail. And please submit the form together with your project.

## Running the tests

i used if statements to generate the scores of the project and then i used my forloops to generate the answers and once the score was found the if statement and forloops would check the score and depeneding on where you fall it gives you your score and tell you how bad or good you were.

Built With: Bulma - The web framework used CSS - used to give it some colour and style HTML - the basic framework PHP - used for the function of the project
